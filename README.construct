construct is a declarative parser/builder that is useful for parsing and
generating LLRP protocol messages.

some tests to run on the construct implementation of LLRP:
* every param has a header
* every param has a unique type
* no unexpected gaps in param type integer space

eventually?
* provide a test string next to each construct
